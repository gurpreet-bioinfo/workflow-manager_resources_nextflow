#### How do you turn processing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) / Omics data, also called as Upstream analysis, into a stress-free and organized experience instead of chaos?
#### A Workflow Manager or Workflow Management System (WfMS) lets you run multiple bioinformatics tools in a well-organized pipeline, making every step reproducible, documented and easy to debug for real peace of mind.
